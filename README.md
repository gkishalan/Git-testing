# Learning Git and GitHub!

## Learning about basics

Git is a **powerful version control system** that helps _developers_ track changes in their code. It allows you to save snapshots, revert to previous versions, and collaborate with others without losing work. **GitHub** is an online platform that hosts Git repositories, making it easy to share projects and contribute to open-source communities.

### Why Learn Git & GitHub?
* 📝 **Version Control** - Keep track of every change in your code.
* 🤝 **Collaboration** – Work with teams from anywhere in the world.
* 🌍 **Open Source** – Contribute to amazing public projects.

> “The sooner you start using Git, the sooner you’ll wonder how you ever lived without it.”

**Example Commands**
```bash
# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Add all files to staging
git add .

# Commit changes with a message
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Push changes to GitHub
git push origin main
```
